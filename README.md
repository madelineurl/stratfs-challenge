# Strategic Financial Solutions Challenge
 Welcome! For this project, I used React to fetch data from the provided API and render it in a table.

 Clone the project into your favorite code editor and run `npm install` from inside the folder to install the project dependencies (which include React, ReactDOM, Babel, Webpack, React Testing Library + Jest, and more!) listed in the `package.json`. You must have node installed on your local machine.

 ## Setup
 Enter `npm start` inside the project folder to launch the application in development mode. This will bundle the frontend with webpack in watch mode and launch a small server at port 8000, where you can view and interact with the app.

 ## Quality Assurance
 Enter `npm test` inside the project folder to run the React Testing Library specs with Jest. The tests verify the app's functionality with a focus on simulating user experience as closely as possible.

 This project also enforces typechecking with the PropTypes library to compensate for some of Javascript's less desirable side effects.
